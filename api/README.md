## Getting Started ðŸš€

---
### Docker
The first thing you need is to setup docker, please follow the step: 
1. https://www.docker.com/get-started/

### Running the project with docker
1. Create a file called .env at the root of the project with the following:
    ```
    PORT=3000
    DB_USER='postgres'
    DB_HOST='db'
    DB_NAME='origin'
    DB_PASSWORD='123456'
    DB_PORT=5432
    API_KEY=<KEY> 
    ```
2. Open your terminal and at the root of the project run:
 ```docker compose up```
3. Run the migrations with the following:
  ```docker exec -it api sh -c "npm run migrations"```
4. The project is already running at **localhost:3000**. You can open the swagger at **localhost:3000/api**

### Running the project without docker
You can also run the project without using the docker. Following these steps:
1. Make sure you have NodeJS (recommend version is 19.7.0) installed
2. Create a file called .env at the root folder with the following:
    ```
    PORT=3000
    DB_USER='postgres'
    DB_HOST='localhost'
    DB_NAME='origin'
    DB_PASSWORD='123456'
    DB_PORT=5432
    API_KEY=<KEY>  
    ```
3. Open your terminal on the root folder and run: 
  ```npm install```
3. Now run:
  ```npm start```
4. And finish running the migrations:
  ```npm run migrations```

## Architecture 
The project uses NestJS and adheres to a hexagonal architecture. Within each module, the code is organized into three layers:

-  Adapters, where we isolate the interactions of the code with external services, such as the database.
-  Core, which contains the bussiness logic(services) and entities.
-  Presentation, where we keep our ccontrollers and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for the module.
